# SleepoLingo

Learning Thai? Use SleepoLingo's flashcards to increase your vocabulary and learn the basics to understand and speak Thai

SleepoLingo uses Spaced Repetition to help you memorize the lessons efficiently. Every day you will learn new flashcards without wasting time on the cards you already know.

And the magic happens at night. Before going to sleep launch the "Night Player" and SleepoLingo will play repeatedly all the content you learned during the day. Just relax and drift off to sleep, listening to the soothing audio recap.

A great way to fall asleep while learning without effort. SleepoLingo helps you memorize better and even helps you to fall asleep!

- Funny flashcard images to help you memorize vocabulary easily.
- The flashcards contain a word and a longer sentence as an example. Learn the full sentence once you are ready.
- Vocabulary split into multiple categories, each with its own lesson notes
- Text to speech to hear the pronunciation.
- Word by word dictionary with transliteration.
- Smart spaced repetition helps you learn efficiently new lessons.
- Night player: Play repeatedly all the new sentences that you learnt during the day (with each translation) while you drift off to sleep!

SleepoLingo only supports iOS and the Thai language for now.
